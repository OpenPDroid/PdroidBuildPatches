PdroidBuildPatches
==================

Build Patches for the Pdroid framework

These patches are based on Syvat's original Pdroid patches, upgraded for ICS by pastime1971
and subsequently brought upward to Jellybean by pastime and me. These are for 4.1.2 currently, and will hopefully be brought up fpr 4.2 soon.

These work for AOSP, AOKP and CM10 at minimum, with 'splitframeworks.diff' and 'java.diff' only being needed for AOSP.
